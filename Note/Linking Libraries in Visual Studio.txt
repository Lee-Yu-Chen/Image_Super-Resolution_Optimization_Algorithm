right click {Project Name} > Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories
> Edit > New Line (button with icon) > ... (button) > select the top level FOLDER containing the header files (usually named "include")




Static linking (the library is built into the program during compile time, therefore the output file would be larger in size, but also (expected to) run faster)

right click {Project Name>} > Properties > Linker > General > Additional Library Directories
> Edit > New line (button with icon) > ... (button) > select the top level FOLDER containing the .lib files (usually named "lib")


Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies > add the filename of the .lib file(s) and ;







Dynamic linking (the library is linked to by the program, and the program would only refer to the library during runtime, 
therefore the output file would be smaller in size, ans also (expected to) run slower)


same step as static linking, just change the Additional Dependencies name to the file with ___dll.lib
and .dll files need to be placed in the same directory with the output files (i.e. .exe file)
